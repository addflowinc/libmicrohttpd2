	 Added MHD_USE_PEDANTIC_CHECKS option which enforces
	 receiving a "Host:" header in HTTP 1.1 (and sends a
	 HTTP 400 status back if this is violated).

	 Fixing assertion failure that occured when a client
	 closed the connection after sending some data but
	 not the full headers.

	 Check for out of memory when adding headers to
	 responses.  Check for NULL key when looking
	 for headers.   If a content reader callback
	 for a response returns zero (has no data yet),
	 do not possibly fall into busy waiting when
	 using external select (with internal selects
	 we have no choice).  - CG

	 Extending API to allow timeout of connections.
