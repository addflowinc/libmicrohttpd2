Run "autoreconf -f -i" to create configure.

This is still pre-alpha software.  The following
things need to be implemented (in list of importance)
before certain features can be used at all:


For POST:
=========
- Decoding of POST data, testing thereof

For http-compliance:
====================
session.c:
- send proper error code back if headers are too long
  (investigate what we should do with those headers,
   read?  give user control?) 
  ALSO: should this limit be per-line or for the
  entire header? (currently,  we enforce per-line,
  but the entire header might make more sense!)
- http 1.0 compatibility (if 1.0, force connection
  close at the end!)

For IPv6:
=========
daemon.c:
- fix start daemon and accept handlers


For SSL:
========
microhttpd.h:
- define appropriate MHD_OPTIONs
- actual implementation


Other:
======
- allow client to control size of input/output
  buffers (add MHD_OPTION)
- allow client to limit total number of connections
  (add MHD_OPTION)
