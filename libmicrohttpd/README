This is still pre-alpha software.  Below we list things that should be
implemented (in order of importance) before we can claim to be
reasonably complete.  #XXXX refers to the respective Mantis bug report
(or feature request).  ARCH indicates that implementing this feature
may require non-trivial ARCHitectural changes in the code.  API
indicates that implementing the feature will require API changes.
TRIV indicates that implementing this feature should be TRIVial.


For http/1.1-compliance:
========================
connection.c:
- support responding immediately with "100 CONTINUE" (http 1.1) (#1263, ARCH)
- send proper error code back if headers are too long
  (currently, we just close the connection) (#1222, ARCH)
- support chunked requests from clients (#1260, ARCH)
- send proper error code back if client forgot the "Host" header (#1264, TRIV)
- automatically add MHD_HTTP_HEADER_DATE if client "forgot" to add one (#1261, TRIV)
- automatically drop body from responses to "HEAD" requests (#1262, TRIV)

For POST:
=========
- find better way to handle POST data that does not fit into memory (#1221, API)
- add support to decode multipart/form-data (#1221)

For SSL:
========
microhttpd.h:
- define appropriate MHD_OPTIONs (#1225, API)
- actual implementation (#1225, ARCH)

Missing Testcases:
==================
- add testcases for http/1.1 pipelining (need
  to figure out how to ensure curl pipelines)
- add testcases for resource limit enforcement
