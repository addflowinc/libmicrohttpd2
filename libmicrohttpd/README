Run "autoreconf -f -i" to create configure.

This is still pre-alpha software.  The following
things need to be implemented (in list of importance)
before certain features can be used at all:


For PUT/POST:
=============
session.c:
- MHD_parse_session_headers (determine upload size)
- MHD_session_handle_read (proper handling of upload end)

For COOKIES:
============
session.c:
- MHD_parse_session_headers: take cookie header apart

For http-compliance:
====================
session.c:
- send proper error code back if headers are too long
  (investigate what we should do with those headers,
   read?  give user control?)
- http 1.0 compatibility (if 1.0, force connection
  close at the end!)

For IPv6:
=========
daemon.c:
- fix start daemon and accept handlers
  (tricky bit will be supporting both on 
   the same socket / port!)

For SSL:
========
microhttpd.h:
- define appropriate APIs
- everything else


Other:
======
- allow client to determine http 1.0 vs. 1.1
  (API extension)
- allow client to control size of input/output
  buffers
