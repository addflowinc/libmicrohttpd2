Run "autoreconf -fi" to create configure.

This is still pre-alpha software.  The following things should be
implemented (in order of importance) before we can claim to be
reasonably complete:


For http/1.1-compliance:
========================
connection.c:
- support responding immediately with "100 CONTINUE" (http 1.1)!
- send proper error code back if headers are too long
  (currently, we just close the connection)
- support chunked requests from clients
- send proper error code back if client forgot the "Host" header (?)
- automatically add MHD_HTTP_HEADER_DATE if client "forgot" to add one (?)
- automatically drop body from responses to "HEAD" requests?

For POST:
=========
- find better way to handle POST data that does not fit into memory
- add support to decode multipart/form-data 

For SSL:
========
microhttpd.h:
- define appropriate MHD_OPTIONs
- actual implementation

Missing Testcases:
==================
- add testcases for http/1.1 pipelining (need
  to figure out how to ensure curl pipelines)
- add testcases for resource limit enforcement
