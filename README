Run "autoreconf -fi" to create configure.

This is still alpha software.  Below we list things that should be
implemented (in order of importance) before we can claim to be
reasonably complete.  #XXXX refers to the respective Mantis bug report
(or feature request).  ARCH indicates that implementing this feature
may require non-trivial ARCHitectural changes in the code.  API
indicates that implementing the feature will require API changes.
TRIV indicates that implementing this feature should be TRIVial.  TEST
indicates that a testcase should be written before implementing the
feature.


For http/1.1-compliance:
========================
connection.c:
- support chunked requests from clients (#1260, ARCH, TEST)

For POST:
=========
- add support to decode multipart/form-data (#1221, TEST)

For SSL:
========
microhttpd.h:
- define appropriate MHD_OPTIONs (#1225, API)
- actual implementation (#1225, ARCH)

Missing Testcases:
==================
- add testcases for http/1.1 pipelining (need
  to figure out how to ensure curl pipelines)
- add testcases for resource limit enforcement

Documentation:
==============
- manual (texinfo, man)
- tutorial
